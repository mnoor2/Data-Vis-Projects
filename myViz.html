        <h1>World Population Density Map</h1>

        <p>
            The geomap visualizes the population density of each country based on its LogDensity. 
            LogDensity is a calculated value that helps to mitigate the impact of extreme outliers 
            in the original data, which would otherwise distort the color shading and make it difficult
            to identify trends. 
        </p>
        <p>
            As expected, countries like India, Pakistan, and China, which are home to a significant 
            portion of the world's population, exhibit high population density. 
            Interestingly, the US, despite having a large population, does not appear to have 
            an equally high density.
        </p>
        <p>
            One limitation of this visualization is the challenge of effectively representing 
            outliers using color coding. To address this, the LogDensity transformation was 
            employed to improve the color shading and enhance the visibility of trends.
